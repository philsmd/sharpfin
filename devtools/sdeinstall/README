SDE INSTALL
===========
This sde-install.exe is able to setup the toolchain needed to compile and develop
apps and packages for Sharpfin. Install this package on WIN only (therefore it is
packaged in a exe) and be sure before installing that cygwin is correctly installed
at C:/Cygwin.

config.txt
==========
This file is used by the Makefile to generate the SFX (SelF Extracting) exe
file that contains the toolchain. It specifies some settings e.g. the prompts,
executable scripts etc.

run.bat
=======
This file will be launched immediately after the user clicks on the EXE, it
actually only starts install.sh which does the main job.

install.sh
==========
This script file extracts the toolchain to the right location at /opt/crosstool.
Cywin is needed to install the SDE correctly.

sde.txt
=======
This file contains some non development specific explanation about sde-install.

sharpfin.sh
===========
Sharpfin.sh will be added to your .profile files such that the environment to use
the crosstools and this SDE is setup correctly.

sharpfin_sfx.xml
================
This file is NOT use by the Makefile but it is the settings file to be used
with 7-Zip SFX Maker. This tool can be installed (open source) from:
http://teejee2008.wordpress.com/7-zip-sfx-maker/
If you like you could add also a ICON with Resource Hacker available at:
http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/ftp/tools/ResHack.zip

7z.sfx,7zS.sfx,7zS2.sfx and 7zD.sfx
===================================
This a different versions of the 7z SFX (Self Extracting) Archive Tool that can be 
defined with a switch in the Makefile.
The Makefile assumes that it is located directly in the 7-ZIP Program folder, if NOT
please set the flag to match your folder.
7zS.sfx seems to implement all options that we need (and have defined in config.txt),
instead 7z.sfx (installed by default w/ 7z) lacks of some features.
You may need to download and install the 7z_extra archive to get these additional
tools.
It is available from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/[NewestVersion]/7z[NewestVerNum]_extra.7z
If you need to install it, please copy the content of the folder to
C:\Program Files\7-Zip\
and then the sde-install Makefile can find it.

PREREQUISITES
=============
You need to have 7z installed and its directory in your $PATH and you also need Cygwin.
The Makefile also assumes that 7z.sfx is in the same directory as 7z and installed in
C:\Program Files\7-Zip
