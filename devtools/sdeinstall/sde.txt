SDE - Sharpfin Development Environment


This suite of programmes is a cross-compiler which has been built
to run under cygwin on an X86 PC.

PREREQUISITES

You must have Cygwin installed,

CONTENTS

This compiler suite includes the following files:

/opt/crosstool             - crosstool cross-compiler
                             GCC version 4.1.0
		             Glibc 2.3.2
		 
/etc/profile.d/sharpfin.sh - Sharpfin configuration bash 
                             startup script
			     
USAGE

Start Cygwin via the start-menu "Cygwin Bash Shell". The compiler
is in the path - it is called 'arm-9tdmi-linux-gnu-gcc'.

It is usual to use Makefiles, and in these, it is usual to refer to
the compiler as $(CROSS)gcc, and define CROSS in a top level Rules.mak
file.



GETTING STARTED
---------------


These notes are correct at the time of going to print, however, always
check with the sharpfin Wiki for the latest instructions.


REPOSITORY

The sharpfin repository can be accessed using SVN.  When in the 
bash cygwin environment, change to an empty directory, and type

   git clone git://github.com/philsmd/sharpfin.git

svn is part of cygwin, so if it is missing, you will need to go back
to your cygwin install.

BUILDING

To build the libreciva library and a test application, cd into git/src
and type:

  make
  
You can also type:

  make clean
  make HARDWARE=devel CROSS=
  
To build the ncurses library, which means that applications are built native
for the local PC using the normal gcc.
  
Not all applications will work in this configuration.
