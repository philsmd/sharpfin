PATCHSERVER
===========

This patchserver enables the changing or installation of firmware
or applications on a Reciva based radio.

patchserver-launcher.exe
------------------------

This program is a windows-based application, and should be run as the
administrator. It obtains an address from the patchfiles.lst file, 
and downloads a list of available patches from an internet server.

Once the user has selected the required patch and real DNS server, the
launcher runs the main application - patchserver-commandline.exe

patchserver-commandline.exe
---------------------------

This program currently requires Cygwin to be installed in order to run.
The program starts a webserver (on port 80) and a DNS server (on port 53)
The Radio must be re-configured to use this machine as its DNS server.
When the radio upgrade is performed, this computer tells the radio where
the patches are.

PATCHFILES.LST
==============

This file either contains a webserver, path and port number - e.g.:
  [DOMAIN] http://[DOMAIN]/[PATH]/?[ATTRIBUTES]=patchfiles.lst 80

or it contains a list of local / remote files to offer:
